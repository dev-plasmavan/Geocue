# Geocue

> Geocue is an application to obtain geographic information about various facilities in Japan. You can obtain not only images and names of facilities, but also coordinates and the websites of those facilities. Tapping the website icon opens the website using WebView in the app, and tapping the pin icon opens a map of the facility in the app. We will continue to update the app to provide the latest information and to refresh the design.
